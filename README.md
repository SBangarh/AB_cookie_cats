# AB testing for Cookie cats

## Purpose
To perform AB testing on player retention for Cookie Cats where we are comparing the gates at level 30 and 40. A gate signifies a paywall or limit. To remove the gate, the player can either make an in-app purchase or wait a time period.

Data was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yufengsui/mobile-games-ab-testing/data) which was sourced from [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/184).
